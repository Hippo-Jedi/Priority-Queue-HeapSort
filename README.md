# Requirements

## Implement a heap-based priority queue

Functions:

  * **`pq_create()`** - This function should allocate, initialize, and return a pointer to a new PQ structure.

  * **`pq_free()`** - This function should free all the memory held within a PQ structure created by `pq_create()` without any memory leaks.  Note that this function only needs to free the memory held by the PQ itself.  It does not need to free the individual elements stored in the PQ.  This is the responsibility of the calling function.

  * **`pq_isempty()`** - This function should return 1 if the PQ is empty and 0 otherwise.

  * **`pq_insert()`** - This function should insert a new value with specified priority into the PQ.  **This operation must have O(log n) runtime complexity.**

  * **`pq_first()`** - This function should return the first value (i.e. the highest-priority value) from a PQ *without* removing it.  **This operation must have O(1) runtime complexity.**

  * **`pq_first_priority()`** - This function should return the *priority value* associated with the first element in a PQ *without* removing that element.  **This operation must have O(1) runtime complexity.**

  * **`pq_remove_first()`** - This function should remove the first value (i.e. the highest-priority value) from a PQ and return that value.  **This operation must have O(log n) runtime complexity.**

## Testing your work

```
make
./test_pq
```
Example output of the testing program using a correct PQ implementation is provided in the `example_output/` directory.

In order to verify that your memory freeing functions work correctly, it will be helpful to run the testing application through `valgrind`.
